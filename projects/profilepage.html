    <h1>Aloha everyone! My name is Dio Lorenzo Bondoc</h1>
    <p>I would like to introduce myself to each one of you. My name is <strong>Dio &copy;</strong>, but people closest to me back home in the Philippines call me <q>Enzo</q> for short. I was born and raised in the <em>beautiful islands of the Philippines.</em> I also served a mission for the church and was assigned in the <em>best mission</em> , <strong>the Philippines Legazpi Mission &reg;.</strong>  </p>

        <blockquote>"Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations."</blockquote>
