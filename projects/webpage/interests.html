        <h2 class="titlefont">Favorite Japanese Animations</h2>
        
        <h3 class="titlefont">Haikyuu!!</h3>
        <p>Haikyuu!! is a japanese animation with a theme  of sport, life lessons, and teamwork. This was the first ever anime that I have watched, and finished it till the end. This anime was also the reason why I started to play volleyball. I was inspired because the main character was a 5'8 kid that can jump high that brought victory to their high school theme. I am 5'8 and being short can be a disadvantage when it comes to sports, but this anime taught me that you should keep on doing what you love.</p>
        <h3 class="titlefont">Attack on Titan</h3>
        <p>This is also a japanese animation with a theme of war, violence, friendship, and betrayal. This anime was not my favorite at first. It was too famous and I thought it was just overhyped. But then, I tried to watch it again, and it was an almost perfect anime. This anime teaches about the cycle of war. It will always start, it will pause, but will never end</p>
        <h3 class="titlefont">My hero Academia</h3>
        <p>This is my third favorite anime. It's like Naruto Shippuden, but more modern. I love how this anime teaches about friendship, and also <span id="emphasis">becoming the person that you want to be.</span> The main character started <span id="coldeemphasize">weak and powerless</span>, but a miracle came when the main character saw his idol and gave him a strand of hair. When he ate it, he got powers that was used to stop evil.</p>
