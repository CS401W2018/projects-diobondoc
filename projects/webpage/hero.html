        <h2 class="titlefont">Dragon Knight</h2>
        <p>Dragon Knight is a strong and straightforward hero who can contribute to his team in many ways. His tankiness allows him to be a frontliner, while his crowd control and burst potential from Elder Dragon Form make him a force to be reckoned with in both early and late game teamfights.</p>

            <dd><strong></strong>Dragon Knight </strong> is part of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian. This faction is ancient where all dragon knights of the world reside. </dd>

            <dd><em>Elder Dragon Form</em> is Dragon Knight's ultimate ability, which transforms him into a more powerful dragon. When activated, his attack range increases, and he gains bonus damage, making him deal significant physical damage in fights.</dd>
            
            <dt id="colemphasize">Weaknesses</dt>
            <dd>Dragon Knight lacks reliable mobility tools to reposition quickly. His Dragon Form is great for pushing towers and dealing damage, but it doesnâ€™t give him mobility. <span id="emphasis">Blink dagger or other mobility items are often necessary to make up for this, but that means he might lack items that boost his tankiness or damage.</span></dd>
