        <h1>CSS</h1> 
        <p>1. Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</p>
        <p>-Inline CSS is put in directly to HTML code. This is not recommended because it makes the HTML code very confusing. Embedded CSS is added in the HTML code by using "style" tag. Like Inline CSS, this is not recommended because it is easily usable. External CSS is like the other two, but this one is externally coded. This is recommended because it improves the maintenance as it is not inside the same code.</p>
        <p>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.</p>
        <p>-We should only use external CSS because it is more accessible and easier to maintain. Using inline and embedded css makes the html code confusing. Another thing is it will make it loader faster.</p>
        <p>3. What is a selector used for?</p>
        <p>-Selectors help us apply styles correctly and efficiently. Without this, there will be a lot of unwanted styles that will happen to the HTML or webpage.</p>
